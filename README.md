# Tutorial Installation Guides

This repo contains the installation guides for the practical tutorials on Day 6 of the CPC. If you are participating in a tutorial session please work through the instructions of your tutorial session so you are ready to go on Saturday. 

## Matlab® licenses
Some tutorials require MATLAB which is commercially distributed by MathWorks®. If your tutorial requires MATLAB but you do not have access to a valid license, please contact us at [cpcourse@biomed.ee.ethz.ch](mailto:cpcourse@biomed.ee.ethz.ch)

## Further support
If you have trouble getting to this point before the tutorial session, please consult the ``#tutorial-helpdesk`` channel on Discord. You will be given access to the CPC Discord workspace at the beginning of the course. Check if anyone has had the same issue and has managed to solve it and how. If no one else has encountered the same problem, post your question.  Florian will be monitoring the channel and providing support. We would be really grateful if you could assist us by answering queries on Discord yourself if you come across a problem, you know and have solved. For those who need more personalized help, we will be offering support hours. More information on the exact time and location will follow.
